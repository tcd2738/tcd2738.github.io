# IGME330-Project1
 Alessandro and I (section 2) would like to use random walkers as a template for building a "Hunger Games Simulator". 
 It would allow the user to upload images and name for individual walkers. The map would be generated randomly and/or
 built by the user. They would then be able to run a simulation with all of the custom walkers they added.
 Some other ideas we have include power-ups for the walkers, phyllotaxis death explosions, and battle music.
