                    <br><br>
                    We used Bud's idea as a base but slimmed it down to better fit our scope. We then looked over the Circle Blast exercise for javascript game creation basics  and thought about how we couldb apply what we learned from that exercise. From there, we put together a basic game loop and some components that we could show off for the prototype. Once the prototype was shown, we used the feedback we recieved to start crafting the final gameplay ideas and mechanics. We then went on to implement those mechaings and add nice touches before the deadline.

                    <span class="inline-heading">Our Challenges and Successes</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Our base gameplay idea is pretty unique. It's a mix of genres and is less of a tech-demo and something that is actually fun to play. It also has simple graphics, but they work, and the game generally all works together design-wise. We were able to add in quite a few features to keep things interesting. Sadly, we were unable to implement true pathfinding/autonomous agents to our enemies, although we did try.
                    <br><br>

                    <span class="inline-heading">How We Met the Requirements</span>
                    <br><br>
                    We made sure to make all of our project deadlines (proposal, prototype, ect.). We used local storage with high scores as our additional HTML5 technology. We created plenty of classes for the game, and there aren't any game breaking bugs.

                    <span class="inline-heading">'Final' Thoughts</span>
                    <br> <br>
                    I believe this is the best website I have created thus far. I met all the requirements, including but not limited to the ‘game treatment’, file structure, valid code, HTML structure, CSS, commenting appropriately, links, images, responsiveness (I am particularly proud of this one!), and spent a long time working on and thinking about the layout. I believe the extras really make the page come together, including the ‘breadcrumbs’ and how the page you are on is indicated by a different color menu text. The website colors fit with the game style as they are rather dark with light highlights, aiming for the light Halloween theme I plan on having. It is a sleek website where not too much is going on, something I was aiming for and I am satisfied with.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="inline-heading">My Process?</span>
                    <br><br>
                    My process was a self-contained one. I only referenced outside material for use once, using only my knowledge from class and previous experiences to create this website. I created a structure that made sense but was empty, then worked on my content and finally came around to the CSS.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="inline-heading">Special Features?</span>
                    <br><br>
                    The only special features I thought were worth mentioning were the transitions near the top (which to be honest are rather basic but still neat!) and the breadcrumbs on each page, showing a tree of links. If the website were to be expanded, the breadcrumbs are a great addition. While there is nothing I can think of worth mentioning as a special feature after that, I am proud of the foundation!
